### Extrinsic Calibration of Stereo Camera and Velodyne LiDAR *June 2018*
-  Developed a ROS package to automate calibration between Velodyne VLP- 16 and ZED stereo camera.
-  Reduced the mean point to point error by 72% compared to manual feature based calibration.

### Real- time Semantic Segmentation on Low- Power Android Devices *May 2018*
- Developed a fast background subtraction for portrait video based on modified SegNet model.
- Model achieved a mean IoU of 87.3% at 30 FPS on Google Pixel 2.

### Estimating Depth from a single image using FCN Network *March 2018*
- Implemented a modified FCN Net and trained it on NYU Depth Dataset and KITTI Dataset.
- Model achieved a mean RMSE error of 0.294 on NYU Depth and 0.312 on KITTI Dataset.
