> Yesterday, a friend in California, when giving me directions, told me I could take the trail toward the tall pines or turn left and find a field of poppies, growing gold and savage at the edge of the valley.  
>  
> When I asked which to choose, she simply shrugged and said: either way, it's all heaven.
