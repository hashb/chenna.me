I ran into this post on linkedin recently. I have personally expirienced some of these problems. I am posting this as a placeholder to write down my own thoughts.

> 1) The Long-Tail Problem in Robotics Is Unforgiving  
> 2) LiDARs Aren’t as Robust as You Think  
> 3) Localization: Easier Said Than Done  
> 4) Scaling Smart: Fewer Clients, More Efficiency—Customization Is a Trap  
> 5) Autonomy Is Just Step One—Integration Is What Matters  
> 6) Running a Robotics Startup Feels Like Running Multiple Companies  
> 7) Global Expansion in Robotics: The Early-Stage Trap  
> 8) The Hardest Part? Building the Right Team
