There are two types of Hypervisors, commonly referred to as Type-1 and Type-2
hypervisor. Type-1 hypervisor or base metal hypervisor or native hypervisor is
when the hypervisor is installed as a firmware at the BIOS level and virtual
machines run on the top. Type-2 hypervisor or hosted hypervisor is when the
hypervisor is installed on top of a host OS and this hypervisor virtualizes
hardware for its guest OS. An example of Type-2 hypervisor is VirtualBox.
