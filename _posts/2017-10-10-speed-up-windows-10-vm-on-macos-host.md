While using Windows 10 Guest on macOS host, I found that Windows was running
really slow. I first tried increasing the RAM to 6GB but there was no
significant improvement in performance. I started tweaking a few settings and
found that enabling 2D and 3D acceleration results in significant performance
improvements.
