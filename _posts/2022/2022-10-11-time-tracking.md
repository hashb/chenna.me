I have been meaning to track my time more seriously but haven't stuck to that
habit. I want to put more effort into it.

I found a [framework](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2PaeRjVqAN7MngxTXFPQkpLVjg/view?resourcekey=0--ZFecHPlfpZ937fUZOeLJQ) by [Alex Vermeer](https://alexvermeer.com/8760hours/) very interesting.
He divides life in to certain categories and plans out what to do the next year. I
think I have enough time this year to work on this.

- **Paid work** (e.g., freelance clients)
- **Passion work** (e.g., side projects)
- **Professional development** (e.g., business development, networking, job applications)
- **Personal development** (e.g., journaling, classes or workshops, inspiring reading)
- **Relationships** (e.g., spending time with family, phone calls with friends, dates)
- **Play** (e.g., shopping, TV, casual reading, going out)
- **Wellness** (e.g., working out, taking necessary breaks, self care)
- **Support work** (e.g., volunteering, mentoring)
- **Distractions** (e.g., flipping through social media mindlessly, taking extra time to get out of bed in the morning)
- **Maintenance** (e.g., running errands, getting ready, doing chores)
