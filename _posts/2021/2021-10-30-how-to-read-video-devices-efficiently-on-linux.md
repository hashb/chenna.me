Using OpenCV VideoCapture on linux uses very high cpu to fetch frames from 
video4linux2 devices and offers low frame rates. 

<!-- more -->

use imageio-ffmpeg instead

Install v4l-utils from apt

```
# to list all devices
v4l2-ctl --list-devices

# list all supported formats by this device
v4l2-ctl --device /dev/video0 --list-formats-ext

# same as above but through ffmpeg
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -list_formats all -i /dev/video0
```
