Docker jargon
- **Image** contains all the additional file changes required to run your
application. This is likely a union of your os files + your application files.
- **Container**
- **Docker Daemon**
- **Docker Client**
- **Docker Hub**
- **DockerFile**

Docker uses *Copy on Write* and *union file system* to optimize resource usage.
It uses Overlayfs filesystem architecture as one of the storage driver
to manage file changes[^1]. 

**Docker Compose** is a tool with which you can define multiple containers
that your application needs and launch all of them with one command.
For example, if your application has a HTTP Server, SQL Database, and a logging
framework, you can define all of them in separate containers and launch them
using Docker Compose.
