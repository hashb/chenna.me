This week in review: Dynamically loading `*.so`, resolving local domains with
mDNS, Code Quality, and be kinder.

<!-- more -->

### Tue, 10 Dec 2019
When dynamically loading plug-in objects, create a dependency graph, find
the lowest common ancestor and start loading the objects from there. This
prevents objects failing to load due to unsatisfied dependencies.▣

If you are not able to resolve local hosts with `hostname.local`, you can try
removing `[NOTFOUND=continue]` from `/etc/nsswitch.conf`. This may or may not
help. This asks the mDNS resolver to quit if it cannot resolve.  
TODO: Lookup how Avahi daemon works.▣

### Fri, 13 Dec 2019
To maintain code quality, monitor 3 things
1. Readability
2. Buildability
3. Testability

This will help you avoid pain down the line. You must also think about 
refactoring as part of your project planning.▣

I saw this quote earlier today and it seemed interesting. I can't disagree
with this, my dreams have significantly diverged from my life right now.▣

Interesting list of projects to try out[^1]. I am particularly interested in the
compiler - Tiny BASIC and mini operating system ones.▣

My version of The Joel Test[^2] 
1. Do you use version control?
2. Can you make a build in one step and are use a CI system?
3. Do you use an Issue tracking system?
4. Do you fix existing bugs before writing new code?
5. Do you have an up to date schedule?
6. Do you have a spec?
7. Do you use the best tools money can buy?
8. Do new candidates write code during interview?

This is not an exhaustive list. I am still trying to understand what is important
for different types of teams. This core list might be valid for all but you might
need additional tests for a team working on frontend development or a team
building a compiler.▣
