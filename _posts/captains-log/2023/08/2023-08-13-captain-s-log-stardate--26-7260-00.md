This week in review: Gita Concept maps

<!-- more -->

### Sun, 13 Aug 2023

Found this interesting site which maps the concepts in the Bhagavad Gita 
[Concept Maps | Gita Supersite](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/conceptmaps).
The map is huge and I am still exploring it. It made me realize that I have
a lot to learn about the Gita. I did read Gita when I was young but I don't think
I grasped a lot of the ideas in the book.
