This week in review: on writing down ideas

<!-- more -->

### Tue, 10 Mar 2020
Two things that have been on the top of my priority list are learning to write
better and managing knowledge and life.

I feel writing clearly to convey ideas is very difficult. A lot of times, when
people write something, they forget that the other person (a lot of times its
the writer who goes back and reads it) does not have the same context and state
of mind as the writer. This can cause the ideas being conveyed hard to grasp.

Now the question is, how do I get better at writing?
