This week in review: on writing down ideas, kernel panics, flatten the curve,
Mindset by Carol Dweck.

Two things that have been on the top of my priority list are learning to write
better and managing knowledge and life.

I feel writing clearly to convey ideas is very difficult. A lot of times, when
people write something, they forget that the other person (a lot of times its
the writer who goes back and reads it) does not have the same context and state
of mind as the writer. This can cause the ideas being conveyed hard to grasp.

Now the question is, how do I get better at writing?

I am running into kernel panic on Linux PREEMPT-RT on version 4.19 and 5.4 when
I try to install `vboxdrv` module. I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to use
virtualbox on a real time linux host. Yesterday I had a breakthrough. vmware
workstation seems to work on real time linux host. Yay!!

I find it very hard to work from home. How do people do it?!

I have also been very bad at social distancing  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
