This week in review: Quantified Self.

<!-- more -->

### Mon, 06 Apr 2020
Quantified Self update: 

1. *Sleep*: Pillow app on Apple Watch can automatically track your sleep. I found
it to be quite reliable. I often add notes on what I have eaten that day and if
I've had alcohol before sleeping. This data is helping he change what I eat and
How much I eat.

2. *Exercise*: I just use the Apple Watch workout app. I have been able to be
more consistent with my workouts after starting tracking them.

3. *Eat*: This is something I still haven't fully gotten a hang of. I am currently
using MyFitnessPal from UnderArmor.
