TCP/IP protocol sucks if you want to do realtime communication.▣

Black Channel vs White Channel concepts for safety are two ideas of how to
implement a Safety system network.[^1] [^2] [^3]

In a Black Channel system, you assume that your medium of communication is not 
safety rated and you perform additional checks at your application layer to 
ensure data reliability. In a system like this, we can use regular network
hardware and treat it as a black box and perform error and data integrity checks
on the application side. This is a much more cost effective option and it is
the type of system a lot of safety system manufacturers use.

In a White Channel system, your entire system is safety rated, down to the last
coupler. This makes it very hard to design and a lot more expensive.▣
