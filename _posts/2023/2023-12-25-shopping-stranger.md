A couple of years ago, I started receiving order notification emails from a strangers
Shein account. I tried to unsubscribe from the emails, but it didn't work, so I
just ignored them. But slowly I started opening the orders to see what this person
was purchasing. It felt wrong but I couldn't help it. I was curious. I wanted to
peek into this strangers life.

At first, it was mostly women's clothes, makeup, bags and jewelry. I
started to imagine what this persons life was like. A young woman who goes out
a lot, likes to dress up and is very fashionable. I imagined her going to
parties, meeting friends, going on dates and having a good time.

Couple of months ago, I noticed something new. There were couple of maternity
clothes in the order. Despite having no personal connection to this person, a
wave of joy washed over me. It felt as if I was sharing a part of her happiness
and excitement on her journey to motherhood.

Most recent order was filled with an array of baby clothes and toys. I have to
admit, following this strangers life through their Shein orders has been an
unexpectedly exciting journey for me. The thrill of observing someone's life
through their purchases was something I never thought I would find so exciting.

ps: based on the color pallet and design of the baby clothes, I think it is a boy.
