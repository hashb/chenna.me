![Last 10 years on Github]({{"/assets/images/20230102/contributions.png"|absolute_url}})

I created my github account almost 10 years go in March of 2013. I was in India for mid 2016. 
I mainly used github for my personal website (github pages) and some Kaggle stuff. 

August of 2016, I moved to Utah for grad school. I worked at 
[LL4MA Lab](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/people) and we mainly used Bitbucket. Because
of that my github is mostly dormant during this period. I became active in 2017 for a brief moment, 
I think this was the year I worked on a bunch of side projects and assignments that I wanted to show off.
I quickly got distracted from this though. 

2018 was when I graduated and started searching for jobs. I joined 
[42 Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)) while searching for jobs.
I was still very undecided if I wanted to do a PhD or go into the industry. I still think about this,
if it was the right choice or not. 

I was very active between 2019 and 2020. This was when I worked at 
[Omron](https://automation.omron.com/en/us/products/category/robotics) and had a very good work life balance.
My contributions tanked once we were fully in lockdown. I got really into fitness and biking in particular.
I did may 100+ km rides on my bike during this time. 

I switched jobs from Omron to [Nimble](https://nimble.ai/) in May of 2021. Work took over most of my time at this point in
my life. Any contributions here were related to stuff I was working on at Nimble.

Early 2022 I got very intestedted in generative art. I worked on creating lot of stuff using processing.
I had a lot of fun doing this. While I stopped posting things publicly, I worked on making quite a few goofy
animations that will probably never be public.
