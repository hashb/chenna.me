Are you forced to work in a Windows environment at work? Do you think Windows
is a pain to work with? Would you rather eat a shoe? Then, this post is for
you. Over the past year, I have been working on a Windows 10 machine. In this
post, I am going to document some tools that I use to make my life a little
better.

Most of these tools are pre-WSL time. I am going to update this post once I
adopted WSL into my workflow.
