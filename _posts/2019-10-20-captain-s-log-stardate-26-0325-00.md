I have been having trouble keeping myself motivated to work on my side
projects. I am not sure if I'd call this a slump but it feels very close
to one. During my time at the LL4MA Lab, I went through a similar phase.
I was stuck on the same problem for a long time and losing motivation to
do any work. My advisor, Dr. Hermans, asked me to write a status update
at the end of everyday of all the things I worked on. The idea was that
I would be able to look back at this at the end of the week and realize
that my time was productive and to keep me motivated.

I have decided to start this process again. This will hopefully serve as
a documentation of my work as well as help me realize all the things I
have accomplised over the week.

I will create a post every Sunday and fill it up over the week. I decided
to call this Captain's log inspired by Star Trek. I will write a more
detailed post on Captain's log and stardates at a later time.

I decided to write a Captain's log and started this post. I extensively
researched how to compute current [stardate].

I have also been looking into building a knowledge base [HN]. I currently
use notion to write stuff in but I don't yet have a system in place.
I should work on this.

[Actiona] is a tool to automate clicks. You can program neat little macros
and run them in a loop. A good alternative to AutoClicker.
