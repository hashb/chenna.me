I've been having trouble keeping myself motivated to work on my side
projects. I am not sure if I'd call this a slump but it feels very close
to one. During my time at the LL4MA Lab, I went through a similar phase.
I was stuck on the same problem for a long time and losing motivation to
do any work. My advisor, Dr. Hermans, asked me to write a status update
at the end of everyday of all the things I worked on. The idea was that
I would be able to look back at this at the end of the week and realize
that my time was productive and to keep me motivated.

I have decided to start this process again. This will hopefully serve as
a documentation of my work as well as help me realize all the things I
have accomplished over the week.

I will create a post every Sunday and fill it up over the week. I decided
to call this Captain's log inspired by Star Trek. I will write a more
detailed post on Captain's log and stardates at a later time.

I decided to write a Captain's log and started this post. I extensively
researched how to compute current stardate[^1].

I have also been looking into building a knowledge base HN[^2].
I currently use notion to write stuff in but I don't yet have a system
in place. I should work on this.

Actiona[^3] is a tool to automate clicks. You can program neat
little macros and run them in a loop. A good alternative to AutoClicker.

Skill stacking[^4] [^5] [^6] seems like a cool idea. Be good at
several things instead of being the best at one thing.

I came across this blog[^7] by John Rauser where he presents
his thoughts on Writing[^8] and Presenting[^9].
I have added them to my reading list a while ago but haven't gotten to
reading them. I will be traveling tomorrow and I should read them then.

It has been a rather unproductive day today. I switched from instapaper to
pinboard. I have been working on setting up my pinboard account. I am still
not sure if I need a new bookmark service.
