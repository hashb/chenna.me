I have had a lot of trouble with the Realsense cameras over USB in the past. Lot of times it is connection drops due to vibration or bandwith saturation in the USB Bus. I recently found out about the FAKRA connector from a friend. I need to do more reading about this but looks like this could solve some of the issues I was seeing.
