*Law of Large Numbers* states that the average of the results obtained from a
large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to
become closer as more trials are performed<sup>[1]</sup>.

When you take a picture with your smartphone, you are selecting a picture from
a buffer that your smartphone is continuously capturing<sup>[2]</sup>.

When deciding a new markup language for your data structure files, remember
JSON for lists and XML for trees<sup>[3]</sup>. XML tags will help you easily
follow the structure of your data, while JSON can get very confusing very
quick.

I recently read an article on why Nokia failed. It boiled down to 3 reasons
<sup>[4], [5]</sup>.
1. Top executives did not have a long term vision
2. Top executives did not listen to the employees
3. Top executives resisted change

It is probably not as simple as that but it is definitely the highlights of
why they failed. On the other-hand, we see Microsoft manage to swing up with a
change in leadership with Satya Nadella.

Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing and all that good stuff.  
I have been looking into deploying Jenkins on a Kubernetes cluster. Also
looking into the whole DevOps cycle.

Worked on a secret project. Servos, pulleys, linkages and weird mechanisms. It
was fun! Will do it again Monday.
