I had been away from ROS world for a while now, but recently had to use ROS for
work. I have not worked with mobile robots before so the terminology is new to
me. In this post, I want to document things I learned about ROS. Currently, it
is focused on mobile robots.

## ROS Transformations for Mobile Robots

## Gazebo on VMWare

Gazebo can sometimes fault when using VMware + Ubuntu with hardware acceleration.
It is unclear why this is happening but the root cause seems to be at VMware's
graphics stack. You can get around this error by setting the environment variable
`SVGA_VGPU10=0`. This tells gazebo to fallback to OpenGL 2.x [^3].

```bash
export SVGA_VGPU10=0
```
