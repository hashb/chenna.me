1. Layered Complexity: example, news papers with large headline with smaller
subtitle, and even smaller content. This way of presenting information helps
people quickly glance at the titles and decide if they want to dive deeper.

2. point and ask: people are usually hesitant to voice their opinion in a
meeting when they feel they are the only one with that particular opinion.
This can cause us to make wrong decisions even when someone knew it was a bad
one. To help people speak their opinions, point to them and ask them the
question.
