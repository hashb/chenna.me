1. *Layered Complexity*: example, news papers with large headline with smaller
subtitle, and even smaller content. This way of presenting information helps
people quickly glance at the titles and decide if they want to dive deeper.

2. *Point and Ask*: people are usually hesitant to voice their opinion in a
meeting when they feel they are the only one with that particular opinion.
This can cause us to make wrong decisions even when someone knew it was a bad
one. To help people speak their opinions, point to them and ask them the
question.

3. *Precision Question and Answers*: Ask questions that result in a one word answer
if you are more curious, you can enquire further. In the same way answer very precisely
to the question with minimal information required. if the person wants to know
more information, they will ask you.

4. *Engineering tradeoff*: When an engineer designs a product, they need to decide
what they are optimizing the design for. like cost, reliability, etc. Engineering
is an art of balancing these design params.
