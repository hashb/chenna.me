Hi!

I am Chenna Kautilya. I work as a Robotics Software Engineer at Omron Research
Center of America (ORCA). My research interests lie in Robotics, Control,
Trajectory Optimization, Motion Planning and Machine Learning. Watch this space
for some exciting news.

I earned a master's degree in Robotics from the University of Utah.
I worked under [Dr. Tucker Hermans](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~thermans/) at the
Learning Lab for Manipulator Autonomy ([LL4MA Lab 🦙](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/)).
During this time, I worked on Grasp Planning using Probabilistic Modeling and
Machine Learning.
