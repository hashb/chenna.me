Hi!

I am Chenna Kautilya. I work as a Software Engineer at Nimble Robotics. I work
at the intersection of Robotics, Machine Learning and Software Engineering.
Previously, I worked at Omron Research Center of America (ORCA) as a Robotics
Software Engineer. At ORCA, I worked on Motion Planning for 6-dof Robotic Arms and
Real Time Distributed system for Robot Control.

I earned a master's degree in Robotics from the University of Utah.
I worked under [Dr. Tucker Hermans](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~thermans/) at the
Learning Lab for Manipulator Autonomy ([LL4MA Lab 🦙](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/)).
During this time, I worked on Grasp Planning using Probabilistic Modeling and
Machine Learning.
