Hi!

I am Chenna Kautilya. I tinker with robots and like to work on ROS and Gazebo.
Currently, I work as a Robotics Software Engineer at Omron Research Center of
America (ORCA). My research interests lie in Robotics, Control, Trajectory
Optimization, Motion Planning and Machine Learning.

I earned a master's degree in Robotics from the University of Utah.
I worked under [Dr. Tucker Hermans](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~thermans/) at the
Learning Lab for Manipulator Autonomy ([LL4MA Lab 🦙](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/)).
During this time, I worked on Grasp Planning using Probabilistic Modeling and
Machine Learning.
