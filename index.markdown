Hi!

I'm Chenna Kautilya, and I specialize in autonomy architecture for robotics
companies ready to move beyond the lab. My work focuses on the systems that
allow robots to plan complex tasks, perceive dynamic environments, and
execute reliably in production.  

At [Medra Robotics](https://medra.ai/), I led the technical redesign of our
autonomy stack, transforming it into a modular platform that could generalize
across tasks. At [Nimble Robotics](https://www.nimble.ai/) and 
[Omron Research Center](https://robotics.omron.com/), I built the
motion intelligence and perception systems that power warehouse automation
and industrial manipulation.

I bring expertise across the full stack—motion planning, control, machine learning,
infrastructure—with a focus on what it takes to deploy robotics systems that actually
work. I earned my Master's in Robotics from the University of Utah, researching
probabilistic manipulation planning at the LL4MA Lab.
